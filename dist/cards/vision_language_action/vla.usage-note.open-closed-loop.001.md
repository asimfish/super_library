### open-loop action prediction versus closed-loop execution

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Open-loop prediction generates an action sequence without incorporating intermediate observations, whereas closed-loop execution refreshes observations and may replan during the sequence.

**Use:** Report prediction horizon, executed chunk length, observation refresh rate, and replanning frequency separately.

**Avoid:** Do not call a chunked policy fully closed-loop merely because a new chunk is eventually predicted.

**Patterns:**

- The policy predicts {prediction horizon} actions, executes {execution horizon}, and replans after receiving a new observation.
