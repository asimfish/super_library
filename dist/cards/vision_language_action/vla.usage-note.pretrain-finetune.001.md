Multimodal representation learning and action-policy optimization use different data, objectives, and sometimes different parameter subsets.

**Use:** Report each stage's data sources, objective, trainable parameters, robot supervision, and evaluation role.

**Avoid:** Do not describe all prior training as robot pretraining when much of it contains no robot actions.

**Patterns:**

- We first pretrain {modules} on {data and objective}, then fine-tune {parameters} on {robot demonstrations} for action prediction.
