**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Predictive dynamics in which future states or observations depend explicitly on the agent's action sequence.

**Use:** Use to distinguish controllable prediction from passive video prediction. Specify action representation, temporal alignment, and prediction target. Use 'path-conditioned' or 'viewpoint-conditioned' when a model conditions on a planned path rather than low-level actions.

**Avoid:** Do not infer controllability from temporal prediction alone or relabel viewpoint conditioning as action conditioning.

**Patterns:**

- The model learns action-conditioned dynamics over {latent state or sensory representation}.
- Conditioning on actions allows the model to evaluate {candidate action sequences}.
