**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

An action-aware predictive model of how an embodied environment evolves in space and time, designed to support capabilities such as planning, policy learning, or interaction prediction.

**Use:** Specify the predicted modalities and geometry, action conditioning, temporal horizon, and downstream decision use. Contemporary methods differ substantially, so treat this as an umbrella term rather than a fixed architecture.

**Avoid:** Do not infer physical consistency, controllability, or policy utility solely from visually plausible generated video.

**Patterns:**

- We use an embodied world model to predict {future sensory or geometric state} conditioned on {robot action sequence}.
- The model supports {planning or policy learning} by coupling {environment prediction} with {action representation}.
