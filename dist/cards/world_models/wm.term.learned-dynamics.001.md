### learned dynamics model

**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

A model fitted from data to predict state or latent-state transitions under actions.

**Use:** Use 'dynamics model' for the transition component; use 'world model' when the broader system may also include representation, observation, reward, continuation, or uncertainty components.

**Avoid:** Do not use 'dynamic model' when referring to environment dynamics; that phrase can mean a model that changes over time.

**Patterns:**

- The learned dynamics model predicts {next representation} from {current representation} and {action}.
