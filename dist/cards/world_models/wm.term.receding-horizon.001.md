### receding-horizon planning

**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Planning in which a finite-horizon solution is repeatedly recomputed as new observations become available.

**Use:** Use when replanning closes the loop. Distinguish action horizon from prediction horizon and note whether an action chunk rather than one action is executed.

**Avoid:** Do not call a single open-loop plan receding-horizon control.

**Patterns:**

- We use receding-horizon planning to reoptimize the action sequence every {k} steps.
