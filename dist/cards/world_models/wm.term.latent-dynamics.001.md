### latent dynamics model

**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

A transition model that predicts the evolution of a learned latent state rather than directly predicting raw observations.

**Use:** Specify the latent state, deterministic and stochastic components if relevant, and the training signals that make it useful for the downstream task.

**Avoid:** Do not imply that operating in latent space automatically yields accurate long-horizon predictions.

**Patterns:**

- We learn a latent dynamics model that maps {latent state, action} to {next latent state distribution}.
- Planning is performed by unrolling the latent dynamics model over {horizon} steps.
