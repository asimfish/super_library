### sample efficiency / data efficiency

`rl.term.sample-efficiency.001` · term · reinforcement_learning, robot_learning · abstract, introduction, related_work, experiments, rebuttal, translation

**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

The amount of environment interaction or training data required to reach a specified level of performance.

**Use:** Name the sample unit—steps, episodes, demonstrations, images, or hours—and compare learning curves or performance at matched data budgets.

**Avoid:** Do not infer sample efficiency from wall-clock speed or final performance alone.

**Patterns:**

- We evaluate sample efficiency by comparing {metric} after {matched number} environment steps.
- The method reaches {performance threshold} using {data amount}.
