### reality gap

**Provenance:** `terminology` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

The discrepancy between simulated and physical observations, dynamics, contacts, sensors, or actuation that can degrade real-world deployment.

**Use:** Identify the relevant mismatch instead of treating the gap as a single scalar phenomenon.

**Avoid:** Do not attribute every real-world failure to the reality gap without diagnosis.

**Patterns:**

- We study the visual component of the reality gap while holding {controller or dynamics} fixed.
- Residual failures are associated with mismatches in {specific factor}.
