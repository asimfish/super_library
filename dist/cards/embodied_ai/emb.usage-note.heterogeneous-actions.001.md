**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Different datasets and embodiments may use controls with different dimensions, frames, grippers, rates, and semantics, so joint training requires a documented representation or adapter.

**Use:** Specify coordinate frames, normalization, missing dimensions, embodiment identifiers, and decoding into each robot's native controller.

**Avoid:** Do not describe actions as standardized when only file formats are shared but control semantics remain different.

**Patterns:**

- We map each dataset's controls into a common {representation} and retain an embodiment-specific action mask.
- Actions are normalized per embodiment before joint training and decoded with {adapter}.
