# Super Library one-file route: Vision-language-action Related Work positioning

`related_work.vision_language_action` · domain `vision_language_action` · section `related_work` · intent `position`

This file is a bounded language context, not scientific evidence. Draft
from the user's verified facts, adapt every pattern, and reopen linked
primary papers before definitions, comparisons, or literature claims.
Do not load the core, catalogs, guide, or cards again for this task.

## Compact contract

- Preserve numbers, notation, negation, uncertainty, comparison direction,
  evaluation scope, and citation placement.
- Prefer field-standard terminology; do not copy a paper sentence or retain
  an unresolved placeholder.
- Bind empirical language to the named protocol, metric, denominator,
  aggregation, uncertainty, and comparison set.
- State evidence before interpretation and retain exceptions, trade-offs,
  null results, and failure boundaries that affect the claim.

## Selected language records

### Prior approaches differ primarily in {axis one} and {axis two}.

`general.sentence-pattern.position.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Organizes related work by technical comparison axes instead of paper-by-paper chronology.

**Use:** Choose axes that expose meaningful assumptions or design choices, then place representative methods along them with citations.

**Avoid:** Do not invent a taxonomy whose categories overlap without explanation.

**Patterns:**

- Prior approaches differ primarily in how they {technical axis one} and whether they {technical axis two}.

### A complementary line of work studies {adjacent problem}.

`general.sentence-pattern.related-family.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Introduces adjacent literature that informs but does not directly solve the same problem.

**Use:** Explain the relationship after the topic sentence: shared tool, assumption, representation, or evaluation setting.

**Avoid:** Do not label directly competing methods as merely complementary to evade comparison.

**Patterns:**

- A complementary line of work studies {adjacent problem}, sharing our interest in {common element} but targeting {different objective}.

### These approaches share {common objective}, but differ in {technical axes}.

`general.sentence-pattern.related-synthesis.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Synthesizes a family of papers through one commonality and one or more technically relevant differences.

**Use:** Support the shared property and each difference with verified citations. Select axes that connect directly to the present method.

**Avoid:** Do not force heterogeneous work into one family merely because papers use similar architectures.

**Patterns:**

- These approaches share the objective of {objective}, but differ in their assumptions about {axis one} and {axis two}.
- While both families address {problem}, they obtain supervision from {different sources}.

### vision-language-action (VLA) model

`emb.definition.vla.001` · definition · embodied_ai, robot_learning, vision_language_action · introduction, related_work, method, translation

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

A model or policy that conditions on visual observations and language and produces robot actions or an action representation for embodied control.

**Use:** Specify all inputs, the action space, control frequency, training data, and whether actions are generated directly, discretized as tokens, or decoded by a separate head.

**Avoid:** Do not call a vision-language model a VLA merely because its textual output can be interpreted by an external planner.

**Patterns:**

- The VLA policy maps camera observations and a language instruction to a sequence of robot actions.
- We fine-tune the pretrained VLA on {number} demonstrations from {target embodiment}.

### separate multimodal pretraining from robot-policy fine-tuning

`vla.usage-note.pretrain-finetune.001` · usage_note · vision_language_action, robot_learning · method, experiments, related_work

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Multimodal representation learning and action-policy optimization use different data, objectives, and sometimes different parameter subsets.

**Use:** Report each stage's data sources, objective, trainable parameters, robot supervision, and evaluation role.

**Avoid:** Do not describe all prior training as robot pretraining when much of it contains no robot actions.

**Patterns:**

- We first pretrain {modules} on {data and objective}, then fine-tune {parameters} on {robot demonstrations} for action prediction.

### open-loop action prediction versus closed-loop execution

`vla.usage-note.open-closed-loop.001` · usage_note · vision_language_action, robot_learning · method, experiments, related_work, limitations

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Open-loop prediction generates an action sequence without incorporating intermediate observations, whereas closed-loop execution refreshes observations and may replan during the sequence.

**Use:** Report prediction horizon, executed chunk length, observation refresh rate, and replanning frequency separately.

**Avoid:** Do not call a chunked policy fully closed-loop merely because a new chunk is eventually predicted.

**Patterns:**

- The policy predicts {prediction horizon} actions, executes {execution horizon}, and replans after receiving a new observation.
