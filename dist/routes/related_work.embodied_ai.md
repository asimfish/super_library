# Super Library one-file route: Embodied-AI Related Work positioning

`related_work.embodied_ai` · domain `embodied_ai` · section `related_work` · intent `position`

This file is a bounded language context, not scientific evidence. Draft
from the user's verified facts, adapt every pattern, and reopen linked
primary papers before definitions, comparisons, or literature claims.
Do not load the core, catalogs, guide, or cards again for this task.

## Compact contract

- Preserve numbers, notation, negation, uncertainty, comparison direction,
  evaluation scope, and citation placement.
- Prefer field-standard terminology; do not copy a paper sentence or retain
  an unresolved placeholder.
- Bind empirical language to the named protocol, metric, denominator,
  aggregation, uncertainty, and comparison set.
- State evidence before interpretation and retain exceptions, trade-offs,
  null results, and failure boundaries that affect the claim.

## Task protocol

### Super Library protocol: Related Work: evidence-verified synthesis and positioning

`related_work` · `section_protocol` · section `related_work` · [protocol index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asimfish/super_library/v0.4.0/dist/guides/index.md)

Load this protocol only for the matching task. It constrains structure and
evidence reporting; it does not supply scientific facts or results.

Organize verified primary papers into problem-relevant families, compare them on explicit axes, and locate the present work without paper-by-paper narration or unsupported priority claims.

**Use when:** Planning, drafting, or revising an AI-paper Related Work section or a focused literature-positioning paragraph.

#### Required inputs

- The exact task, setting, and claim that the literature discussion must contextualize.
- Verified primary papers with bibliographic metadata and notes tied to specific passages.
- A small set of organizing families and explicit comparison axes such as objective, supervision, data regime, assumptions, compute, or deployment setting.
- The present paper's factual relationship to each relevant family, including shared assumptions and material differences.

#### Functional protocol

##### 1. Verify the literature evidence (required)

- Open every primary paper used for a definition, historical claim, method characterization, or comparison.
- Record what the cited passage supports and do not infer absent limitations from silence.
- Use the library's source IDs only as navigation; never treat a corpus summary as the citation evidence.

##### 2. Build a task-relevant taxonomy (required)

- Group papers by the technical choice that matters to this paper rather than by arbitrary chronology.
- State the comparison axis before naming examples from a family.
- Separate families that solve different problem settings instead of ranking them together.

##### 3. Synthesize similarities and differences (required)

- Describe a recurring approach, then identify a verified assumption, mechanism, or scope difference.
- Make the subject of every evaluative statement explicit: method, dataset, protocol, or result.
- Distinguish reported evidence from the authors' interpretation and from this paper's synthesis.

##### 4. Position the present work precisely (required)

- State what is shared with prior work before the differentiating axis.
- Name the changed assumption, supervision, data, mechanism, evaluation, or deployment constraint.
- Do not imply superiority unless a verified comparable experiment supports it.

#### Choose one internal template

##### Taxonomy-first synthesis

Use when: Several approach families address a common task under different assumptions.

1. Define the shared task and organizing axis.
2. Describe the first family and its operative assumption.
3. Contrast the next family on the same axis.
4. Synthesize the unresolved boundary across families.
5. Position the present work on that boundary.

##### Concept evolution

Use when: Chronology is scientifically meaningful because later work changes a specific assumption or capability.

1. State the original formulation or capability with a primary source.
2. Describe the verified change introduced by subsequent work.
3. Compare the resulting families on a stable axis rather than merely listing years.
4. Identify the remaining problem addressed here.

#### Verification

- Every citation exists, has been opened, and supports the adjacent proposition at the stated scope.
- Every comparison names a common axis and avoids ranking incompatible protocols.
- Definitions are paraphrases unless a short quotation is explicitly marked and permitted.
- The section represents close alternatives fairly, including assumptions that favor the present method.
- No claim uses latest, first, only, most, or state-of-the-art without a separately verified comparison set.

#### Avoid

- One sentence per paper with no cross-paper synthesis.
- Citation clusters whose individual sources do not support the whole sentence.
- Describing prior work only through limitations while omitting its intended setting or strength.
- Using temporal recency as a proxy for relevance, quality, or novelty.

## Selected language records

### Prior approaches differ primarily in {axis one} and {axis two}.

`general.sentence-pattern.position.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Organizes related work by technical comparison axes instead of paper-by-paper chronology.

**Use:** Choose axes that expose meaningful assumptions or design choices, then place representative methods along them with citations.

**Avoid:** Do not invent a taxonomy whose categories overlap without explanation.

**Patterns:**

- Prior approaches differ primarily in how they {technical axis one} and whether they {technical axis two}.

### A complementary line of work studies {adjacent problem}.

`general.sentence-pattern.related-family.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Introduces adjacent literature that informs but does not directly solve the same problem.

**Use:** Explain the relationship after the topic sentence: shared tool, assumption, representation, or evaluation setting.

**Avoid:** Do not label directly competing methods as merely complementary to evade comparison.

**Patterns:**

- A complementary line of work studies {adjacent problem}, sharing our interest in {common element} but targeting {different objective}.

### These approaches share {common objective}, but differ in {technical axes}.

`general.sentence-pattern.related-synthesis.001` · sentence_pattern · general · related_work

**Provenance:** `original_pattern` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Synthesizes a family of papers through one commonality and one or more technically relevant differences.

**Use:** Support the shared property and each difference with verified citations. Select axes that connect directly to the present method.

**Avoid:** Do not force heterogeneous work into one family merely because papers use similar architectures.

**Patterns:**

- These approaches share the objective of {objective}, but differ in their assumptions about {axis one} and {axis two}.
- While both families address {problem}, they obtain supervision from {different sources}.

### embodied AI

`emb.definition.embodied-ai.001` · definition · embodied_ai, robot_learning · abstract, introduction, related_work, translation

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

The study of agents that perceive and act within an environment, where their observations, actions, and learning are shaped by embodiment and closed-loop interaction.

**Use:** Specify the body, sensors, action space, environment, and task. For simulated agents, state which physical or interaction constraints are modeled.

**Avoid:** Do not use 'embodied' for a passive model that only processes a fixed image or text dataset without an interaction formulation.

**Patterns:**

- We study embodied AI agents that perceive {sensory inputs} and act through {action space} in {environment}.
- The agent's observations depend on its previous actions, creating a closed perception–action loop.

### evaluate embodied generalization along separately controlled axes

`emb.usage-note.systematic-generalization.001` · usage_note · embodied_ai, robot_learning, vision_language_action · experiments, limitations, rebuttal, translation

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

Systematic evaluation varies identified factors—such as objects, placements, task templates, prompt compositions, environments, or embodiments—while documenting which combinations were withheld.

**Use:** Define each split procedurally and report results by axis. Use 'zero-shot' only when the evaluated factor or combination was absent from training under the stated protocol.

**Avoid:** Do not collapse all held-out conditions into one generalization score that hides qualitatively different shifts.

**Patterns:**

- We report separate results for unseen objects, unseen task compositions, and unseen embodiments.
- The hardest split holds out both {factor one} and {factor two} during training.

### separate prediction horizon, execution horizon, and feedback frequency

`emb.usage-note.chunking-feedback.001` · usage_note · embodied_ai, robot_learning, vision_language_action · method, experiments, limitations, rebuttal, translation

**Provenance:** `paraphrased_synthesis` · **Quality:** `gold+reviewed`

A policy may predict many future actions while executing only part of them before receiving a new observation, so action horizon alone does not determine whether control is open-loop or closed-loop.

**Use:** Report all three quantities and explain how overlapping predictions are combined. Use 'closed-loop' only when updated observations influence subsequent executed actions.

**Avoid:** Do not infer the control-feedback structure solely from the number of actions output by the network.

**Patterns:**

- Although the policy predicts {k} actions, it replans after executing {n}, using a new observation.
- The controller executes the entire chunk open-loop before the next policy query.
